## ðŸ“¦ Installation

**PyPI (recommended):**
```bash
pip install meditor
```

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hunminkim98/MEditor.git
cd MarkerStudio
pip install .
```

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Recommended: Run from the project root

```bash
# From the project root directory (the folder containing MEditor/ and README.md)
python -m MEditor.main
```

- This ensures all package imports work correctly.
- Do NOT run main.py directly from the MEditor/ subfolder, as this may cause ModuleNotFoundError.

### 2. Alternative: Directly run main.py (with sys.path workaround)

If you want to run main.py directly (not recommended for production), make sure the following lines are at the top of MEditor/main.py:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
```

Then you can run:

```bash
python MEditor/main.py
```
